Class component will alert current value, however function component will alert snapshot. This is not a bug. This is a common question in Javascript due to the fact that every time you passing same reference or not. See another example: closure loop problem In React, Because props is immutable(assign a new obj when you want to change it) in functional component, each rendering has different props. Every click will generate a new props and setTimeout() display the value when you click. However, in Class component. After class generated, props is associated with class itself. Every rendering in class component have same this.props and this.props.user change overtime. Therefore, setTimeout() use same this.props and access this.props.user which is current value. This flowing code simulate this problem let props = { count: 10 }; const fnA = ({ count }) =\u003e { click = setTimeout(() =\u003e { console.log(count); }, 1000); click; }; class fnB { constructor(input) { this.props = input; } click = setTimeout(() =\u003e { console.log(this.props.count); }, 1000); } fnA(props); let res2 = new fnB(props); res2.click; props.count--; props.count--; props.count--; Solution Since we know different props display snapshot and same reference display current value. To get snapshot in class component, just assign the data that will alert to a new variable. (give several different value) To get current value in functional component, add a ref(react) / create a value outside the component and store value to it.

Predictive teams in the traditional SDLC models usually work with detailed planning and have a complete forecast of the exact tasks and features to be delivered in the next few months or during the product life cycle. Predictive methods entirely depend on the requirement analysis and planning done in the beginning of cycle. Any changes to be incorporated go through a strict change control management and prioritization. Agile uses an adaptive approach where there is no detailed planning and there is clarity on future tasks only in respect of what features need to be developed. There is feature driven development and the team adapts to the changing product requirements dynamically. The product is tested very frequently, through the release iterations, minimizing the risk of any major failures in future. Customer Interaction is the backbone of this Agile methodology, and open communication with minimum documentation are the typical features of Agile development environment. The agile teams work in close collaboration with each other and are most often located in the same geographical location. reference ","date":"2019-09-03","objectID":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/software-development-1/:1:0","tags":["ssw","course note"],"title":"Software Development Course note","uri":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/software-development-1/"},{"categories":["Software-development"],"content":"Rational unified process (RUP) Develop iteratively Manage requirement Use component-base architecture Model software visually Continuously verify software quality Control changes ","date":"2019-09-03","objectID":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/software-development-1/:2:0","tags":["ssw","course note"],"title":"Software Development Course note","uri":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/software-development-1/"},{"categories":["Software-development"],"content":"Boehm’s risk exposure comparison Time and effort invested in plans↑ –\u003e risk↓ ; lost of market share↑ ","date":"2019-09-03","objectID":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/software-development-1/:3:0","tags":["ssw","course note"],"title":"Software Development Course note","uri":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/software-development-1/"},{"categories":["Software-development"],"content":"Extreme programming The planning game Small release Metaphor - a simple explanation of project Simple design Testing Refactoring - Not changing the behavior and update the code Pair Programming Collective ownership - Everyone not knows everything but knows something about every part Continuous integration - integrate and test frequently.

char client_data[1]; /* The client sees this. */ }; union 是说明 free_list_link 这个指针和用户数据共用一段内存空间。 这样当在 list 中时，其中储存的是下一个的地址。如果不在 list 中被释放出来给用户使用， 那么存储的用户数据就会把 list 指针覆盖掉。 总之这是一个非常有意思的技巧。专门适合这种在两种类型之间切换同时可以节省空间不用同时维护两种信息。这个只能用于 c++。对于像是 java 这种强类型的语言，这种技巧不存在。 當它發現 free list 中沒有可用區塊了，就呼叫 refill()準備為 free list 重新填充空間。新的空間將取自記憶池(經由 chunk_alloc() 完成)。預設取得 20 個新節點(新區塊)，但萬一記憶池空間 不足，獲得的節點數(區塊數)可能小於 20 從記憶池中取空間給 free list 使用，是 chunk_alloc() 的工作 上述的 chunk_alloc() 函式以 end_free - start_free 來判斷記憶池的水量。 如果水量充足，就直接撥出 20 個區塊傳回給 free list。如果水量不足以提供 20 個 區塊，但還足夠供應一個以上的區塊，就撥出這不足 20 個區塊的空間出去。這時 候其 pass by reference 的 nobjs 參數將被修改為實際能夠供應的區塊數。如果記 憶池連一個區塊空間都無法供應，對客端顯然無法交待，此時便需利用 malloc() 從 heap 中配置記憶體，為記憶池注入活水源頭以應付需求。新水量的大小為需求 量的兩倍，再加上一個隨著配置次數增加而愈來愈大的附加量。 萬一山窮水盡，整個 system heap 空間都不夠了(以至無法為記憶池注入活水源 頭)，malloc() 行動失敗，chunk_alloc() 就四處尋找有無「尚有未用區塊， 且區塊夠大」之 free lists。找到的話就挖一塊交出，找不到的話就呼叫第一級配 置器。第一級配置器其實也是使用 malloc() 來配置記憶體，但它有 out-of-memory 處理機制(類似 new-handler 機制)，或許有機會釋放其他的記憶體拿來此處使用。 如果可以，就成功，否則發出 bad_alloc 異常。 ","date":"2019-07-21","objectID":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/:3:2","tags":["c++","STL"],"title":"Allocator in c++","uri":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/"},{"categories":["STL-study-note"],"content":"Memory basic processing function STL 定义了五个全域式函数，用作于内存未被初始化的空间上。construct(), destroy(),uninitialized_copy(),uninitialized_fill(),uninitialized_fill_n(). construct(), destroy()是用来构造和解构对象的。 uninitialized_copy(),uninitialized_fill(),uninitialized_fill_n()是对三个 non-POD 类型(non-Plain Old Data).内存算法。对于 POD(像是基本类型)会调用高级函数(copy(),fill(),fill_n()) ","date":"2019-07-21","objectID":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/:4:0","tags":["c++","STL"],"title":"Allocator in c++","uri":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/"},{"categories":["STL-study-note"],"content":"uninitialized_copy(begin,end,begin2) 将迭代器 begin1~end(尾后迭代器)所代表的输入范围 copy 到 begin2 开始的内存,begin2 所指向的内存必须大于 begin~end 所需的； ","date":"2019-07-21","objectID":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/:4:1","tags":["c++","STL"],"title":"Allocator in c++","uri":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/"},{"categories":["STL-study-note"],"content":"uninitialized_fill(begin,end,t) 在迭代器 begin~end 范围内构建 t 的拷贝； ","date":"2019-07-21","objectID":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/:4:2","tags":["c++","STL"],"title":"Allocator in c++","uri":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/"},{"categories":["STL-study-note"],"content":"uninitialized_fill_n(begin,n,t) 从 begin 开始的内存构建 n 个 t 的拷贝； ","date":"2019-07-21","objectID":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/:4:3","tags":["c++","STL"],"title":"Allocator in c++","uri":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/"},{"categories":["STL-study-note"],"content":"Summary allocator 是用来开辟空间的。 construct 和 destroy 是用来构建对象。剩下的三个函数是算法。对一段空间的拷贝。对一个对象的重复拷贝。 ","date":"2019-07-21","objectID":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/:5:0","tags":["c++","STL"],"title":"Allocator in c++","uri":"https://tyrangyang.github.io/TyrangYang_blog/allocator/"},{"categories":["STL-study-note"],"content":"Basically, Functor have same functionality with interface in java.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: {% highlight ruby %} def print_hi(name) puts “Hi, #{name}” end print_hi(‘Tom’) #=\u003e prints ‘Hi, Tom’ to STDOUT. {% endhighlight %} Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk.
