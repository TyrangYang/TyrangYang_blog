# Git overview


Here have some good pictures that is helpful for understanding git and contain the record for git commend

## Concept Map

Here is a concept map given by Udacity.com. This picture shows the relationship between these basic git concept.

## Git Data Transport Map

Git have four working zones. This map shows that using which commend to shift your code from one zone to another.

## Git commend and usage

### Initialize the git repository

`git init`

### Clone a repository by giving the URL (github)

`git clone <repository URL>`

### Show the status (Status of Index)

`git status`

### Show the log of commit

`git log`

#### show all logs in graph and each log in one line

`git log --graph --oneline <branch name> <branch name>`

#### show specific number of log

`git log -n <number>`

### Compare workspace and index

`git diff` compare workspace and index area (basically just show what you are not add)

`git diff head` compare index area and head in local repository

`git diff <commit ID>` compare index area and given commit ID in local repository

`git diff <commit ID> <commit ID>` compare two given commit

### Add

`git add <filename>`

`git add .` add all

### Commit

`git commit -m '...'`

#### add and commit

`git commit -am '...'`

### Branch

#### show all branch

`git branch`

#### Open a new branch

`git branch <branch name>`

#### Open a new branch and checkout

`git checkout -b <new branch name>`

### Push

`git push <remote name> <branch name>`

### Pull

`git pull <remote name> <branch name>`

```
       A---B---C master on origin
      /
D---E---F---G master
    ^
    origin/master in your repository
```

After run`git pull master`

```
      A---B---C origin/master
     /         \
D---E---F---G---H master
```

### pull something have conflict

Sometimes branch in local and remote are not sync. For example:

```
      A---B---C origin/master
     /
D---E --- F  master
```

In this case, we can run `git pull --rebase <remote> <branch> `. You can move your local commit at behind.

```
D---E---A---B---C---F' (F' is a new commit)
```

### Merge

`git merge <branch>` merge a given branch to current branch

Eg: `git merge feature` (when you on master branch) --> merge branch feature into master.

### Remote

#### show all remote

`git remote`

#### show all remote detail

`git remote -v`

#### giving a new remote name and connect it to a URL

`git remote add <remote name> <URL>`

### Fetch

`git fetch <remote name>`

`git fetch origin b`
Without changing workspace, update local repository from remote repository

In another word, fetch will update `origin/master`

### Roll back

`git reset --soft HEAD~1` Roll back 1 commit into index area

`git reset --hard HEAD~2` Roll back 2 commits into workspace

### Remove some file in Index

`git rm --cached <file name>`

`git rm -r --cached .` This command will set file to be untraced.

`-r` means recursively

`--cached` means remove file in index

> Update **.gitignore**. delete something that you add in gitignore and commit before

### Rebase

Suppose we have this situation and you are **currently on branch _feature_**

```
      A---B---C feature
     /
D---E---F---G master
```

The _base_ of _feature_ is commit `E`. Therefore `rebase` means you change the _base_ depends on your given branch

After you run `git rebase master`, branch will be like:

```
              A'--B'--C' feature
             /
D---E---F---G master
```

## Fast-forward(ff) in merge

{{< admonition type=warning title="" open=true >}}
**fast-forward is by default for `merge` command**
{{< /admonition >}}

Suppose you have two branches `master` and `feature`

```
      A---B---C feature
     /
D---E  master
```

### What is ff merge?

If you run `git merge feature` in master branch, it will be come

```
      A---B---C feature & master
     /
D---E
```

**HEAD** of master branch will direct forward to **TARGET_HEAD**

### Disable ff (--no-ff)

If you run `git merge --no-ff feature` in master branch, new commit will force to create.

```
      A---B---C feature
     /         \
D---E-----------F master
```

### Why need ff merge?

It is related with `git pull` actually. `git pull` will call either `git rebase` or `git merge` to reconcile diverging branches.

A very common case is like:

```
      A---B---C master on origin
     /
D---E  master
    ^
    origin/master in your repository
```

And run `git pull` is similar with run `git merge origin/master`. The best(actual) result of this command:

```
D---E---A---B---C master & origin/master
```

`pull` is comprised of `merge`. ff by default means, `pull` will try to use ff `merge` first and then create new commit. Logically more reasonable.

Beside ff provide a fast and clean branch management.

> Reference: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge

### Why need --no-ff merge?

**The biggest reason is keep clean branch history.**

Consider there will more commit after feature branch:

If we use `--no-ff`

```
      A---B---C---G---H feature
     /         \
D---E-----------F master
```

You can see `feature` branch is fully traceable. Commits (A B C G H).

However, if ff happen.

```
      A---B---C---G---H feature
     /        ^
D---E         master
```

`feature` branch is incomplete when trace back. Only **Commits(G H)**. Commits(A B C) will be consider as part of master branch.

For team collaboration, this lost is not a good practice

## Compare merge, merge --squash and rebase

If we have two branches `master` and `feature`

```
      A---B---C feature
     /
D---E---F---G master
```

### merge

If run `git merge`

```
      A---B---C feature
     /         \
D---E---F---G---H master
```

### merge --squash

if fun `git merge --squash` and `git commit`

`H` combine `A B C`

```
      A---B---C feature
     /
D---E---F---G---H master
```

Now you have _feature_ branch and update the _master_. You may delete _feature_ later

### rebase

After you run `git rebase master` when you **on branch _feature_**:

```
              A'--B'--C' feature
             /
D---E---F---G master
```

You can `checkout` _master_ and run `git merge feature`:

```
D---E---F---G---A'---B'---C' master & feature
```

## git revert

```
a - b - c - d   Master
```

Then run `git revert HEAD`

```
a - b - c - d - d'   Master
```

`d'` revert all change in d

## git cherry-pick

```
a - b - c - d   Master
     \
       e - f - g Feature
```

Then run `git checkout master` & `git cherry-pick f`

```
a - b - c - d - f   Master
      \
        e - f - g Feature
```

## Git config

Usually config your github email account and username in global

### list all global config

`git config -l`

### set user name and email

```sh
git config --global user.name "your name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

### set password cache

`git config --global credential.helper cache` and **next password/token entering will be cache**
`git config --global --unset credential.helper` will unset cache state

### How to manage multiple github accounts

https://www.heady.io/blog/how-to-manage-multiple-github-accounts

## Delete submodule

1. Delete the relevant section from the .gitmodules file.
2. Stage the .gitmodules changes git add .gitmodules
3. Delete the relevant section from .git/config.
4. Run git rm --cached path_to_submodule (no trailing slash).
5. Run rm -rf .git/modules/path_to_submodule (no trailing slash).
6. Commit git commit -m "Removed submodule "
7. Delete the now untracked submodule files rm -rf path_to_submodule
